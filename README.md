# odin-recipes
<!-- write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.) -->
This odin-recipes project is to familiarize myself with using HTML to create a basic skeleton for a website. This includes a main index page with individual recipe pages, complete with headings, paragraphs, lists, and links. Other skills that will be practiced are the git workflow, navigating files, and publishing GitHub pages.
